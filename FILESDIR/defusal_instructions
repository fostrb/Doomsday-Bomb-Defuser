>Bomb defusal requires disarming SOFTWARE and HARDWARE locks.
    1: HARDWARE
        -Carefully remove components from the bomb.
        -Upon the successful removal of all components, the bomb will display a code.
        -This code will be required to disarm the software component of the bomb.

    2: SOFTWARE
        -Run the unlock utility to unlock both crypto keys.
            -Keys are spit out as morse, just decode them.
        -AFTER unlocking both cryptographic keys with the unlock utility AND disarming the hardware, we need to run cryolock.
            -cryolock will prompt you for a passcode
            -This is the code displayed on the disarmed hardware (It will be required)
            -Disarm the bomb using the cryolock utility after entering the passcode
